# My personal website

This is the code for my [personal website](https://giodamelio.com).

## Running it locally

The site is build using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/). With a recentish version of Node installed it is easy to spin up the dev server or build a production dist.

```shell
# Run the dev server
npm install
npm run develop

# Build a production deploy to `build/`
npm install
npm run build
```
