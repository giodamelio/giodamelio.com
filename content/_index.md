# Hi! I'm Giovanni d'Amelio

I'm a programmer of things, lover of tinkering and learner of weird facts. I am always tinkering on some random project.

## Projects

Some random projects I have made or contributed to:

 - [little_boxes](https://github.com/giodamelio/little_boxes): Puts pretty boxes around stdin
 - [NixOS Config](https://github.com/giodamelio/nixos-configs): The NixOS configs that configure all my computers

## I'm looking for work

If you are looking for a generalist software developer with a love for all things open source, I would love to hear from you. [Check out my resume](@/resume.md)
